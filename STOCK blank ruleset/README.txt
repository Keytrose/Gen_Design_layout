This is a blank set of folders and basic .xml files meant to be used as a template for the creation of a custom
Fantasy Grounds ruleset.

A complete ruleset is possible without the need to populate all of these folders, it will entirly depend on the complexity
of the ruleset you are applying. All modern Fantasy Grounds rulesets are suggested to be layered over the CoreRPG ruleset
this gives a much greater portability between systems. It really shouldn't be done any other way.
